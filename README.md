# Workshop Repository: LLMs and Algorithmic Thinking in Python

Welcome to the **LLM Workshop** repository! This collection of interactive **Jupyter Notebooks** is designed to introduce and deepen your understanding of **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, natural language processing (NLP), and the underlying algorithms that power them.
  
- **Interactive Learning**: Each notebook contains explanations, interactive coding challenges, and exercises to reinforce learning. You'll get hands-on experience working with LLMs, tokenization, embeddings, and more.

- **Challenges & Optimization**: Some problems in the workshop offer additional challenges that encourage you to optimize your solutions or explore more advanced techniques.

### **Topics Covered**
- **Workshop 0:** Python review, algorithms, and introduction
  
### **Usage**
To get started, clone this repository and open the notebooks using Jupyter:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/llm-workshop-python.git
cd llm-workshop-python
```

Each notebook is self-contained, allowing you to experiment with the code and explore the topics at your own pace. The **algorithmic thinking** section at the beginning will help you hone your problem-solving skills, while the **LLM workshops** will introduce you to cutting-edge techniques in NLP.

### **License**
This repository is open-source and free to use under the MIT license.

### **Getting Started**
To get started, clone this repository and start exploring the notebooks:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/atong28/LLMWorkshop.git
cd LLMWorkshop
```
