    "### **Workshop 0: Algorithmic Thinking and Python Review**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Introduction**\n",
    "This assignment consists of a set of **challenging Python problems** designed to enhance your algorithmic thinking and problem-solving skills. These problems are intentionally difficult, requiring you to apply core programming concepts, data structures, and algorithms. The purpose is to not only implement solutions but also to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to use any resources at your disposal—online documentation, textbooks, or tutorials. While you are encouraged to limit your use of AI tools, they are available as a resource. If you do use AI, make sure you can fully explain how your solution works and the reasoning behind your approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you get stuck, don’t hesitate to reach out for help! Discuss the problems with peers, consult online resources, or ask me for guidance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Testing**\n",
    "You're encouraged to create your own test cases to deepen your understanding and validate your solutions. For each problem, try to come up with a variety of test cases, including edge cases and scenarios that challenge the assumptions made in the problem description. This practice will help you think critically about the problem, ensure your code handles all potential inputs, and improve the robustness of your solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Submission**\n",
    "Submit your solutions as Python scripts or Jupyter Notebook files. Ensure each problem is clearly labeled, and include a brief explanation of your approach at the top of each solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good luck! These problems are meant to challenge and inspire you. If you need help, don’t hesitate to ask—whether it’s clarifying the problem, debugging your code, or brainstorming approaches. Learning through collaboration and persistence is key!\n",

    "\n",
    "#### **Problem Description**\n",
    "Write a Python program to process a given text file and compute the frequency distribution of words based on a provided vocabulary list. Tokenize the text using **longest prefix tokenization**, where the program identifies the longest matching token from the vocabulary at each position in the text. After computing the frequencies, plot the sorted frequency distribution, ensuring that the most frequent tokens appear on the leftmost side of the plot.\n",
    "\n",

    "   - A text file containing a block of text (e.g., `input.txt`).\n",
    "   - A vocabulary list containing valid tokens in json format (e.g., `vocab.json`).\n",

    "2. **Output**:\n",
    "   - A frequency distribution plot where tokens are sorted in descending order of frequency.\n",

    "   - Implement **longest prefix tokenization**:\n",
    "     - At each position in the text, find the longest token in the vocabulary that matches the substring.\n",

    "   - Plot the sorted frequency distribution using a library like `matplotlib`.\n",
    "\n",

    "#### **Optional Challenge**\n",

    "\n",
    "#### **Guidelines**\n",
    "1. **Longest Prefix Tokenization**:\n",
    "   - Loop through the text starting from each character.\n",
    "   - At each position, check the longest matching token from the vocabulary.\n",
    "   - Add matched tokens to the result list and skip to the end of the matched token.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Trie-Based Optimization**:\n",
    "   - Build a trie from the vocabulary list.\n",
    "   - Traverse the trie to find the longest matching token.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Visualization**:\n",
    "   - Use `matplotlib` to create a bar chart of the sorted frequency distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Additional Notes**\n",
    "- The lower one eighth block \"▁\" is a commonly used character for LLM tokenizers to include prefix spaces in the vocabulary. Notice that the token \"▁is\" is different from \"is\". Can you see why this is useful? One of the first steps you will need to do when tokenizing is to replace all prefix spaces with this character \"▁\". Also, notice that the start of the sequence has a \"▁\" appended to it too! Can you justify this?"
